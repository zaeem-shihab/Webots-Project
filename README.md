The provided code implements a wheeled mobile robot simulation in Webots designed to autonomously navigate a maze.
The robot uses proximity sensors, a light sensor, and GPS to explore the environment, detect dead ends, and prioritize brightly lit areas.

Key components of the implementation include:
1. Sensor integration: 8 proximity sensors, a light sensor, and GPS
2. Motor control for differential steering
3. Wall-following algorithm with dead-end detection
4. Light-based prioritization of dead ends
5. Modular function structure for initialization, navigation, and data logging

The main function orchestrates the robot's operations, including sensor data collection, dead-end detection, navigation, and data logging.
The robot explores the maze until it reaches the maximum number of dead ends or finds the brightest dead end.

Notable features:
- Dynamic motor speed adjustment based on sensor readings
- Efficient dead-end detection and recording mechanism
- Use of GPS for precise position tracking
- Light intensity-based prioritization of explored areas

The implementation demonstrates effective sensor integration, modular design, and an intelligent exploration strategy for autonomous maze navigation.
